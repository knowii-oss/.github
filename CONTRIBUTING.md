# Contributing to Knowii
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow.

## Code of Conduct
Help us keep Knowii open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
## Contributions
There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code..

### Financial support
It’s possible to support us financially by becoming a backer or sponsor through. Please contact us over at contact@developassion.be for more information.

### Improve docs
As a user you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etc.

### Improve issues
Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.
You can help triage issues, add labels, etc.

### Participate in community discussions
Participating in [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/knowii-oss/discussions) is an awesome way to help our community.

### Write code
Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue
- The issue tracker is for issues. Use discussions for support
- Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue
- Ensure you’re using the latest version of our projects/code
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error message, version, operating system, etc
- The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
- The best issue report is a failing test / reproduction

Always submit issues to the most relevant repository. For the core platform, this should be the [main Knowii repository](https://github.com/knowii-oss/knowii).

## Got a question or problem?
Create GitHub discussions: https://github.com/orgs/knowii-oss/discussions

## Found a bug?
If you feel like you've discovered a bug, then a GH issue is clearly the way to go, with a follow-up PR indeed ;-)

## Missing a feature?
You can _request_ a new feature by submitting an issue to our repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

## Project-specific guidelines
Make sure to take a look at the contributing guide of the specific repository you want to contribute to.
