# Contributing to Knowii

As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow.

## Code of Conduct

Help us keep Knowii open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Got a question or problem?

Create GitHub discussions: https://github.com/orgs/knowii-oss/discussions

## Found a bug?

If you feel like you've discovered a bug, then a GH issue is clearly the way to go, with a follow-up PR indeed ;-)

## Missing a feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by submitting an issue to our repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

## Project-specific guidelines
Make sure to take a look at the contributing guide of the specific repository you want to contribute to.
