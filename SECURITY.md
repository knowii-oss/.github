Security Policy

## Introduction
DeveloPassion acts as the security contact for the Knowii open source project. If you were referred here by a project to report a security issueâ€¦ you've come to the right place!

## Vulnerability response
We will do our best to acknowledge reports within 5 business days.

Any information shared with the DeveloPassion security team stays within DeveloPassion and will not be disseminated except as required to get the issue fixed or to coordinate a vendor response.

As a security issue moves through our process we will keep the reporter updated.

Our goal is to disclose bugs as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. We will set a disclosure date once the bug is well-understood (in consultation with the bug reporter and the relevant project maintainers).

## How to report a vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability in Knowii, please report it to security@developassion.be.
