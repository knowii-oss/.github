Security Policy

## Introduction
DeveloPassion acts as the security contact for the Knowii open source project. If you were referred here by a project to report a security issue… you've come to the right place!

## Vulnerability response
We will do our best to acknowledge reports within 5 business days.

Any information shared with the DeveloPassion security team stays within DeveloPassion and will not be disseminated except as required to get the issue fixed or to coordinate a vendor response.

As a security issue moves through our process we will keep the reporter updated.

Our goal is to disclose bugs as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. We will set a disclosure date once the bug is well-understood (in consultation with the bug reporter and the relevant project maintainers).

## How to report a vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or website governed by Knowii, we encourage you to notify us over at security@developassion.be. 

## Safe harbor
We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder. If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local information
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
- We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement. We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third party against you
- Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences
- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact
- Submit one vulnerability per report
- Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
